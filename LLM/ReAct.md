# ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models

本文介紹了一種名為 ReAct（Reason + Act）的方法，該方法將語言模型中的推理和行為結合起來，以解決各種語言推理和決策任務。這一方法在各種任務中取得了卓越的表現，如多跳問答、事實核查和交互式決策任務。ReAct 通過緊密集成推理和行為來提供具有可解釋性、可診斷性和可控性的人類對齊任務解決軌跡。ReAct 的實驗結果表明，它具有結合內部知識和外部獲得的信息進行推理的能力。此外，文章還探討了 ReAct 與人類合作的可能性，通過讓人類檢查員編輯 ReAct 的推理痕跡，可以改變模型的行為以符合檢查員的修改，從而成功完成任務。

This article introduces a method called ReAct (Reason + Act), which combines reasoning and acting in language models to tackle various language reasoning and decision-making tasks. This method demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as multi-hop question-answering, fact checking, and interactive decision-making. ReAct tightly integrates reasoning and acting, providing human-aligned task-solving trajectories with improved interpretability, diagnosability, and controllability. The experimental results of ReAct show its ability to combine both internal knowledge and externally obtained information during reasoning. Additionally, the article explores the possibility of human-machine collaboration with ReAct by allowing human inspectors to edit its reasoning traces, thus changing the model's behavior to align with inspector edits and successfully complete tasks.
